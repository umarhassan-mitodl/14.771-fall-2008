Course Requirements
-------------------

An essential requirement of the class is the mandatory paper readings. There will be one paper assigned for every other lecture. You must read this paper extremely carefully. There will also be questions to be answered and turned in at the beginning of the lecture (you can work in groups of maximum 4 and hand in one set of answers). We will discuss this paper at length in class. Instead of recapitulating the content of the paper, we will assume everyone has read it and discuss specific details of the paper.

Grading
